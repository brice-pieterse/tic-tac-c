### Tic Tac Toe in C

This was an assignment for an introduction to C programming in my Computer Systems University course.

The goal was to familiarize myself with the basic building blocks of a C program. Along the way, I was excited to have several "aha" moments, where syntax or rules in a higher level language like Javascript that formerly seemed arbitrary could now easily be explained by its heritage from C.

Be aware, this might not be your most challenging opponent. I left out the intelligence in counter moves for now, focusing instead on the input/output and basic "drawing" logic behind the game.

Enjoy!
